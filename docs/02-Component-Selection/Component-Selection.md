    | Pros                                                              | Cons                |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
    | clear mono audio output with low distortion                       | More expensive      |
    | Built-in shutdown mode to save power when idle                    | Requires PCB layout for noise reduction|
    | small speaker in water detection system                           | 

**Choice:** Option 1: NCP2809BDMR2G surface mount Integrated Circuits (ICs)

**Rationale:** The NCP2809BDMR2G is a low-power stereo audio amplifier we use in the water detector to boost the alert sound from a sensor signal, ensuring a clear and audible warning when water is detected and can save up power ensuring it will keep up the alarm until someone comes.
