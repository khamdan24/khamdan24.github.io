### Schematic
## Overview
This schematic provides the core alert functionality for the Water Detection System. It integrates power regulation, microcontroller-based tone generation, and visual indication using a PIC18F57Q84 microcontroller and a simple piezoelectric or magnetic speaker. The system operates from a stable +5V supply. The microcontroller processes sensor inputs and generates an audible alert directly via a GPIO pin, driving a small speaker through a current-limiting resistor and optional transistor for louder volume.
