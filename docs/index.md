<font size= "8"> Project Name: Water Detector System: Speaker </font><br>
for<br>
<font size= "5"> Team 208 </font><br>


## Introduction

* My data provides details on the purpose, design, and functionality of the speaker and LED subsystem. This component serves as a critical alert mechanism in the system, ensuring users are immediately notified when a potential water leak is detected. The datasheet is intended to give readers a clear understanding of how it works and supports the overall system goals, and integrates with the teamâ€™s broader design.

### Project Summary

* The Water Detection System is designed to detect and alert users to potential water leaks in residential or commercial environments. The system integrates multiple sensors, like pressure, water, and humidity, all connected to a central microcontroller that processes data and activates alarms and pings the LED when abnormal conditions are detected.
* My version of the project focuses on the alert and notification, which converts digital signals from the microcontroller into visual warnings and audio. When a leak is detected, the microcontroller activates an audio amplifier circuit that drives a speaker, producing a clear alarm sound. Simultaneously, an LED indicator lights up to provide a visual confirmation of the alert.


### My Contribution

My contribution centers on the design, implementation, and testing of the speaker and LED alert system. My primary responsibilities include:
* Designing the audio amplifier circuit to power the speaker using the appropriate gain and voltage levels.
* Integrating the speaker and LED with the microcontroller for synchronized alert activation.
* Testing and optimizing sound output and LED brightness to ensure visibility and audibility under various environmental conditions.
* Collaborating with team members to align alarm timing and control logic with sensor data processing.
